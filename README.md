# content-based-video-segmentation
planned handling prgress:

The code shall be written in python.

1. Take a input video, compress the video into smaller format (optional).
2. Calling an api to cut the video into single frames.
3. Transfer the frame into matrixes.
4. Progressing the algorithm to compare the matrixes. 
5. Output different contents. (different method, segment of videos, frames, creating file for each group of frames, maybe a few api for video segmentation is needed.)
6. User interface(optional).
